"@:(foe_data.gb.The_Arc) is a GB that gives a bonus that increases the "

"the Arc is high, more the reward are important.\n"
"\n"
"That's how we started talking about 1.8, 1.9, etc. In reality, this is the "
"Arc bonus.\n"
"In fact, 1.0 represents the basic reward, 1.8 represents the reward with an "
"Arc level 70 (it gives 80% more reward at that level) and 1.9 represents "
"the reward with an Arc level 80 (90% more reward).\n"
"\n"
"Threads exclusively reserved for this type of investment were created in "
"guilds and groups of friends. This is based on the principle of \"I give "
"what I get\", thus limiting conflicts between guild members or friends by "
"not making profits on their GBs. Unlike endless threads (10, 50, 100, "
"etc.), the other advantage of 1.8, 1.9, etc. threads is that it saves a "
"considerable amount of time for the GB owner. This is because the owner "
"only needs to put in the necessary number of FPs to secure places that are "
"going to be taken by level 80 Arcs (in the case of thread 1.9).\n"
"\n"
"Let's take an example:\n"
"\n"
"Let's imagine that you want to raise your @:(foe_data.gb.Observatory) from "
"level 10 to 60 and that you earn {fp50} per day.\n"
"The total cost of the levels is {fp64975}.\n"
"\n"
"If you are using endless threads, your investment will be 1:1, i.e. {fp25} "

"you will have to <strong>invest {fp37320}</strong> to reach level 60. At "
"{fp50} per day, it will take you <strong>2 years and 17 days</strong>.\n"
